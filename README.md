# Live-Plant-Monitoring-system
This is a project made using Arduino UNO and a DHT11 sensor that takes temperature and humidity from the surrounding and sends the data to the computer from which the data is extracted using python and live graph is plotted.

This below given is the connection for the Arduino with the DHT11 sensor, just make sure that you connect the green wire shown here to the **A0 pin** of the Arduino Board.

After the connection is made connect the arduino with the computer, open the arduino IDE and upload the **tempSensing** code to the Arduino UNO board.
After the code is uploaded, reconnect the board to the computer and run the python file.

*congrats, your live graph is ready and working!!!*

**For any queries, open an issue, I'd be more than happy to help you out.**
